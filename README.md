Quick Start
===========


Announcements
=============

-   Work has began Jan 9th

Installation 
============

Bunny is going to be distribute via PyPi and as the content store grows we can expand it to other pieces of software
making it accessible to all regardless of what you use. Alternatively, you could have a glance at the source code and copy/paste
it yourself.

To install the reader 

```

python -m pip install bunny

```

Structure of Bunny
==================

Currently, the main subpackages are:

- **bunny**: Bunny Main Class


Genesis
=======

Bunny was created because I am forced to port forward my jupyter notebooks through a gateway server and there is no way 
around it due to bureaucracy.
